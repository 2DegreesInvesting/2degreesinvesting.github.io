At 2DII we use a particular set of tools and practices. This post is about what you should know to work effectively at 2DII or any of the many organizations that use the same tools and practices.

### Introduction to GitHub

We collaborate on GitHub and use a workflow called [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Whatever your experience with GitHub, I recommend these resources:

* Video (4'): [What is GitHub](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E).
* Tutorial (1-2 h): [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) (from [GitHub Lab](https://youtu.be/9S0p8YMQzsM)).

### Connect GitHub and RStudio

Most of our code on GitHub is written in R from RStudio. Here is how to set things up:

* Book chapter: [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). If you are already set, use this guide to confirm we are all set in the same way.

* Video (35'): [How to contribute to GitHub from the terminal and from RStudio](https://youtu.be/y8lOGz1yAj4)^[Caveat: In this video I violate the GitHub flow in that I submit a pull request not from a `feature` branch (as I should) but from the `master` branch.].

### Why Git, and how it relates to GitHub and RStudio

If you never used Git before you may ask, What is Git and why do we use it?

The heart of GitHub is Git. We use Git to keep track of every meaningful change in our projects. In general we do this from RStudio. This resource can help you understand why we bother; but you may skip it if you already use Git and think it's indeed useful.

* Video (50'): [Collaboration and time travel- version control with git, github and RStudio](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/collaboration-and-time-travel-version-control-with-git-github-and-rstudio/)

### Next

We are working on multiple projects you may want to know [about](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/about.html). Please engage and share your ideas with us.
