At 2DII we use a particular set of tools and practices. Here is all you need to know to hit the ground running.

### Introduction to GitHub

We collaborate on GitHub and use a workflow called [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Whatever your experience with GitHub, I recommend these resources:

* A 4' video: [What is GitHub](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E).
* An interactive tutorial (1-2 h): [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) from [GitHub Lab](https://youtu.be/9S0p8YMQzsM).

### Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub

Most of our code on GitHub is written in R, and from RStudio. Here is how to set things up:

* Book chapter on how to [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). If you are already set, use this guide to confirm we are all set in the same way.

* A 35' [video](https://youtu.be/y8lOGz1yAj4) showing how to contribute to GitHub from the terminal and from RStudio (but it violates the GitHub flow in that it pushed commits from master instead of a feature-branch).
