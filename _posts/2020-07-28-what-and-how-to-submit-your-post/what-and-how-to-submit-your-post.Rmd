[The first post on this blog encouraged you to submit your own posts](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-06-02-shape-and-share-your-thoughts-here/); but the advice was vague about what to submit or how. This post makes the advice concrete.

## What to submit

Each published article needs only two things:

* A title, e.g. "Publish your post here".

* A body, i.e. the contents of your post.

And it is nice to have a few optional things:

* A description, e.g. "Details on what and how to submit a new blog post".

* A link to your website, e.g. <https://github.com/maurolepore>.

* An image that is licensed to share publicly, e.g. from <https://www.pexels.com/creative-commons-images/>.

* One or more categories to help readers filter similar posts, e.g. "meta".

Most of this is just plain text, which is easy to submit for publication in a number of ways.

## How to submit

The priority is to publish your content; how you do it is unimportant -- you may submit it however you like. For example, here are some ways:

* Slack: Send me or Jackson a file via Slack with your text or a link to it (e.g. a link to a Google Doc).

* GitHub: On GitHub, [create a new file](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/2degreesinvesting.github.io/new/master) and paste your text in it.

GitHub will automatically fork the blog's repo into your user account and guide you to create a pull request.

* RStudio: Fork the blog's repo; create a new RStudio project from your fork; create a new post with `distill::create_post()`; commit your changes; push your commits to your fork; submit a pull request to the blog. 

Get to the pull request stage as quickly as possible so we can start the conversation about your post early. The technical details don't matter -- we can help you with that. What is important is your idea; share it.
