r2dii.analysis approaches its first release but first we'd love you to try it out and give us some feedback. Please report bugs, and incorrect or unclear documentation; you may also suggest changes to the interfaces, such as a better name for a function,  or argument. 

Install the development version of r2dii.analysis from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.analysis")
```

Then load it with:

```{r}
library(r2dii.analysis)
```

The best place to start your review is its [website](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/index.html). Start reviewing the home page, then each item under [Reference](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/index.html), and finally each of the two article ([1](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/articles/target-sda.html), [2](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/articles/target-market-share.html)). At every stage ask yourself three questions:

* Does the code run as expected?
* Are the examples useful?
* Is the documentation clear and the style natural?

You may leave a quick comment at the end of this post, or a longer comment as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.analysis/issues/new/choose).

Thank you!
