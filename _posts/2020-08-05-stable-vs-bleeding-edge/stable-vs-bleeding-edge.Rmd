The `r2dii` packages are a suite of R packages that help users implement some of 2DII's common analysis tasks easily in R (check out [this post](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-06-30-r2dii-suite-is-now-on-cran/)). As these packages are still in active development, it can become confusing for users to know which version of the package they have installed/ are using and where to find information and help for their version.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

## What Version of my Package is Installed?
As of now, every open source package that 2DII writes has a life on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is where we keep track of every little change we make to the code,
