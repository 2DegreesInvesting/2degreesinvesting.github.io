While most of the joining and calculations occur under the hood, there are also 
some utility functions that may be of interest to some analysts.

I generally prefer a more personal style. I write with someone in mind, such as Sasha -- an analyst at Bank of America. Then "some analysts" becomes "you".

Here the actor is implicitly "the package", or "the code", "we (the developers)" or similar. I would do it explicit.

Also, sentences are generally clearer and active when you map actions to verbs. The first verb here is "occur" and the action is burried in so called nominalizations: Joining and calculations. 

My revision:

While the package joins and calculates [what?] under the hood, it {the package} also includes utility functions you may use:

Maybe this is not exactly what you meant but shows how I aim to review. What most strongly influenced my writing is the "[Readers expectations approach](https://georgegopen.com/reader-expectation-approach)"

If we both write using the same systematic approach, our documentation will be more consistent. If you follow some other approach let me know and we can discuss.
