Open source packages improve thanks to people like you who [kindly contribute to open source software](https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/). Your contribution to the packages we build can be as simple as raising an issue. Here is how you can do just that.

Each packages has a website with a link to report a bug or raise any relevant issue (more on this below). For example, the website of the package r2dii.match lives [here](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match) and looks like this:


```{r report-bugs, fig.cap="The website of every package has a link to report a bug."}
knitr::include_graphics("http://i.imgur.com/UkMPpem.png")
```

The link to report a bug opens a page with two fields:

1. A Title (like the "subject" of an email) to summarize your issue;
2. A body to detail your issue. Please follow our instructions carefully to avoid emails and solve the issue quickly. We know you are busy.

```{r open-an-issue, fig.cap="The web page to report a bug is like an email."}
knitr::include_graphics("http://i.imgur.com/TNxi4xB.png")
```

## What's beyond our scope

Our scope is limited. We assume you are familiar with R. We can't teach you R but you may like [our favorite resources to learn R](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alearn+label%3Arstats). The issues we can address are those caused specifically by the packages we build. Report everything else at <https://stackoverflow.com/> or <https://community.rstudio.com/>.

The most common out-of-scope problems are installation errors. It's unlikely the problem comes from our packages because we continuously check that they install correctly with -- multiple version of R -- on Mac, Windows, Linux, and several other platforms ([example](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_r2dii.match.html)). What should you do then?

### A tale of two R programmers

Mike and Lucy are working together and want to use the package r2dii.match. They try to install it with `install.packages("r2dii.match")` but they get an error.

> Lucy: "Bummer!"

> Mike: "Wait; let's read the error message carefully."

The error message makes no sense. Lucy Googles it and finds some promising results. Mike tries a few hacks but nothing works.

> Lucy: "It's all sooooooo confusing; but there is something about versions, right? These R geeks move fast -- they pump new stuff every day!"

> Mike: "What if we ask at <https://community.rstudio.com/>? Everyone there seems quite friendly?"

> Lucy: "Yes, those folks _are_ cool; but let's first update everything -- I mean R, RStudio, and all R packages. It can't hurt and sooner or later we'll have to do it anyway. [Here is a nice guide](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)."

> Mike: "Yeah, it never seems like a good time to update. Let's just bite the bullet."

After an hour or so they are done.

> Lucy: "Okay, here we go again: `install.packages("r2dii.match")`."

> Mike: "Fingers crossed."

They look at each other. Then Lucy runs the code. Then it just works.

Takeaway:

> Get current, people. You donâ€™t want to adopt new things on day one. But at some point, running old versions of software adds unnecessary difficulty. -- [How to think about upgrading R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)
