Open source packages improve thanks to people like you who [kindly contribute to open source software](https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/). Your contribution to the packages we build can be as simple as raising an issue. Here is how you can do just that.

Each packages has a website with a link to report a bug or raise any relevant issue (more on this below). For example, the website of the package r2dii.match lives [here](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match) and looks like this:


```{r report-bugs, fig.cap="The website of every package has a link to report a bug."}
knitr::include_graphics("http://i.imgur.com/UkMPpem.png")
```

The link to report a bug opens a page with two fields:

1. A Title (like the "subject" of an email) to summarize your issue;
2. A body to detail your issue; please follow our instructions carefully. We know you are busy. The effort you invest in following these instructions will save you from answering our questions, and ultimately will solve your issue faster.

```{r open-an-issue, fig.cap="The web page to report a bug is like an email."}
knitr::include_graphics("http://i.imgur.com/TNxi4xB.png")
```

## What's beyond our scope

Our scope is limited. We assume you are familiar with R. We can't teach you R but you may like [our favorite resources to learn R](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alearn+label%3Arstats). The issues we can address are those caused specifically by the packages we build. Everything else is beyond our scope and you should report elsewhere -- maybe at <https://stackoverflow.com/> or <https://community.rstudio.com/>.

The most common out-of-scope problems are installation errors. It's unlikely the problem comes from our packages because we continuously check that they install correctly with -- multiple version of R -- on Mac, Windows, Linux, and several other platforms ([example](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_r2dii.match.html)). What should you do then?

### A tale of two R programmers

Mike and Lucy are working together and want to use the package r2dii.match. They try to install it with `install.packages("r2dii.match")` but get an error.

- Lucy: "Bummer!"

- Mike: "Wait; let's ready the error message".

They both try to interpret the error message but it makes no sense. Lucy Googles the error message and finds some promising results. Mike tries a few things but fails; Lucy tries a few more things but nothing works.

- Lucy: "It's all quite confusing but there is something about versions. These R people move fast; there is new stuff every day. Maybe the R stuff we have is just too old".

- Mike: "What if we ask at <https://community.rstudio.com/>? Everyone there seems quite friendly?"

- Lucy: "Yes, those folks _are_ cool; but let's first update everything -- I mean R, RStudio, and all R packages. It can't hurt and sooner or later we'll have to do it. [Here is a nice guide](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)".

- Mike: "Yeah, it never seems like a good time to do it so let's do it now".

After an hour or so they are done.

- Lucy: "Okay, here we go again: `install.packages("r2dii.match")`".

- Mike: "Fingers crosses".

They look at each other; then Lucy runs the code and ...

It just works.
