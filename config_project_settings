**Target Audience:**

Everyone who uses the PACTA_analysis script for their projects.

**What changed:**

The workflow for initializing a project has changed. A new required config file must be used and was added to the repo.

**Specifics:**


Project wide settings should be set in the file "project_settings.yml", prior to project initialization: 

``` yml
    project_name: name_of_the_project_folder
```

   - Please define `project_name`. The project name is relevant for input, output and naming of data files.

``` yml
    project_internal:
      twodii_internal: FALSE
```

   - Ensure that the variable `twodii_internal` is set `FALSE`. Value should only be set to `TRUE` for 2DII internal staff.  

``` yml
  project_internal:
    ...
    project_location_ext: ~/path/to/project
```

   - Please define ```project_location_ext``` by copying the full path to the folder, in which you want to store data (including the results) related to this particular evaluation. During the run of the code, the a project folder with several sub-folders will be created here.
   - Please consider: 
     - copying in a path from windows requires to change all "\" to "/" (e.g. "C:/Users/Desktop/project_folder/)
     - path needs to be a string ("...")

``` yml
  project_internal:
    ...
    data_location_ext: ~/path/to/data
```

   - Please define ```data_location_ext``` by copying the full path to the folder, in which you stored the data files (set of rda files) provided by Asset Resolution or the 2DII.

   - Please consider: 
     - copying in a path from windows requires to change all "\" to "/". 
     - path needs to be a string ("...")
